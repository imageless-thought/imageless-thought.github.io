Git has been around since 2005 and is widely used for collaborative software development. But it has wider uses. As examples it is used by writers and artists to track changes as it keeps a complete history and changes can be rolled back to any point. You can grant access to your projects and allow others to submit changes: those changes can be reviewed by the owner and merged, rejected, or a separate branch created. Even if you just use Git to track your own changes to your work (articles for publication, photographs - any electronic work) the benefits are considerable and it is worth your time to take a look at the information below. Learn how you can use Github to host a personal website for free. This is an excellent way to learn to use Git and you get a free website as well. Github is free as long as you keep your repositories public. If you want to have private repositories, you would have to upgrade to Pro (just under $4 a month as of June 1, 2023). However, Github does offer free plans for students and instructors. Encourage your students to take advantage of this offer and also apply for the free Student Developer Pack. The Student Developer Pack contains tools are services that would otherwise be quite costly. Github is very popular but there are other options available: GitLab and Bitbucket. Relevant Links" />
