Github For Everyone</h2>
      <p><b><a href="https://git-scm.com/" alt="Git Website">Git</a></b> is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. <a href="https://github.com/" alt="Github">Github</a> is very popular but here are other options available, such as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" alt="Gitlab Website">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" alt="Bitbucket Website">Bitbucket</a>.</p>
<p>Git has been around since 2005 and is widely used for collaborative software development.  But it has wider uses.  As examples it is used by writers and artists to track changes as it keeps a complete history and changes can be rolled back to any point.  You can grant access to your projects and allow others to submit changes: those changes can be reviewed by the owner and merged, rejected, or a separate branch created.</p>
<p>Even if you just use Git to track your own changes to your work (articles for publication, photographs - any electronic work) the benefits are considerable and it is worth your time to take a look at the information below.</p>
<p>Learn how you can use Github to <b><a href="https://pages.github.com/" alt="Github Pages website">host a personal website for free</a></b>. This is an excellent way to learn to use Git and you get a free website as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/" alt="Github">Github</a> is free as long as you keep your <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories" alt="Git Repositories">repositories</a> public.  If you want to have private repositories, you would have to upgrade to Pro (just under $4 a month as of June 2, 2023).  However, Github does offer <a href="https://education.github.com/benefits" alt="Free Github for Educational Use">free plans for students and instructors</a>.  Encourage your students to take advantage of this offer and also apply for the free Student Developer Pack.  The <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" alt="Github Student Pack">Student Developer Pack</a> contains tools are services that would otherwise be quite costly.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world" alt="Github Tutorial">Github</a> offers a pretty solid tutorial for using Git through their service.</p>
<p>There are also video tutorials\training available:</p>
<li><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" alt="Coursera Website">Coursera</a></b> offers a free course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-git-and-github" alt="Coursera Course on Github">Getting Started with Git and Github</a>.  The course covers everything you would need to know but takes about 8 hours to complete.
<li><b><a href="https://itss.untsystem.edu/divisions/mrs/it-training/linkedin-learning.php" alt="LinkedInLearning Login Portal for UNT">LinkedInLearning</a></b> offers some shorter (under 2 hours) getting-started options:<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github-18719601" alt="LinkedInLearning Course: Learning Github">Learning Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github-14213624" alt="LinkedInLearning">Learning Git and Github</a>.
<p>Enjoy and happy computing.</p>
