<meta name="description" content="Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) allows you to install Linux distributions on your Windows 10 or 11 machine without the need for a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly from Windows. You can actually install multiple Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and Oracle Linux) and have them running at the same time. WSL 2 is only available for Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or later. If you are running a compatible version of Windows 10, you will need to update your version of WSL. Windows 11 was released with WSL 2 installed. To get started, visit the Microsoft website for WSL2. Some improvements in WSL2: Uses a full Linux kerel. Support for full system call compatibility. Faster boot time and improved performance. GNU\Linux graphical applications can be run directly from Windows. Improved file system performance. Use GPU acceleration for machine learning and data science. A thorough comparison of WSL 1 and WSL 2 is available on the Microsoft website. WSL2 Development Environment: A tutorial for setting up WSL2 as a development environment. Basic WSL commands: Powershell commands to setup and configure WSL2. Windows Commandline: A development blog that provides updates and useful information on WSL. A cheatsheet for Linux commands, there are plenty of others available. If you are new to Linux or need a refresher, a free training video produced by the The Linux Foundation is available." />
